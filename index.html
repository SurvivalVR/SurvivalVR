         <h5>Learning Objective</h5>
         <p>The learning objective of our VR experience is to address the topic of common survival/medical misconceptions and their consequences when people are ill-informed. 
         With so much technology and so many resources at our fingertips, it's easy to forget how much we don't understand about surviving real,
         life-threatening situations. Our VR experience puts the user through a nature hike in which their partner is put in immediate danger
         and/or is severly injured. We then give the user options to pick what they would do to help their partner, making sure to include options 
         about many common misconceptions typical users have on the subject. Although in a way this can be comical, its also a very real fact that people are 
         losing their "innate" survival skills that early humans once had. With this basic knowledge slowly fading, more and more people
         are put in medical danger from other people mis-handling situations. This VR experience, in a way, is trying to demonstrate to the
         user how ready they are for these situations in a less stressful environment and demonstrating the future consequences of their choices. </p>

         <h5>Scientific Data</h5>
         <p>Our scientific sources include:
          <ul>
            <li>http://www.wildbackpacker.com/wilderness-survival/articles/treating-a-snake-bite/</li>
                In this article, it discussed the do's and don'ts of snake bites and the outcomes based on different medical 
                treatments given.
            <li>http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Bites-snake/Pages/Treatment.aspx</li>
                This resource discusses the treatments of snake bites including anti-venoms which medical response teams would have.
            <li>http://www.bearsmart.com/about-bears/dispelling-myths/</li>
                This resource discusses common myths about how to approach different types of bears in the wild and discusses the proper 
                responses as well as the outcomes for all types of defense decisions.
            <li>http://blog.theclymb.com/tips/9-survival-myths-kill/</li>
                This resource talks about many of the common survival myths that flood our media, including sucking venom out of a snake bite.
                The excitement of television and movies often trumps fact, sadly, and this cause many to be very ill-informed about 
                basic safety procedures.

         <h5>User Choices/Decisions</h5>
         <p>These are the different choices that the user is faced with throughout the experience.
         <ul>
            <li><em>Choice 1: Mountain or Valley</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Mountain Camping</li>
                <li>Valley Camping</li>
            </ul>
            The different locations will dictate which animal that you will encounter. Typically, bears will live high up in the mountains and snakes will tend to dwell by water sources, especially if they are water snakes, such as water mocosins.
            </li>
            <li><em>Choice 2: How to react in the emergency situation</em> 
            <ul>
              <li>Valley/Snake Emergency</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Splint</li>
                Using a splint to restrict movement is the best way to go. You want to wrap the area in a compression bandage as firmly as you would a sprained ankle. Do not cover the bite area.
                <li>Suck Out Venom (Popular Belief)</li>
                Trying to suck the venom out of a wound is generally not a good idea. It can damage the area around or contaminate the wound more and is not an effective means to help the victim.
                <li>Tourniquet</li>
                Using a tourniquet is typically not a good idea in most cases. After being applied for even 2 hours, permanent tissue damage can occur. They are also not effective in stopping the spread of venom as it is already in the bloodstream.
                <li>Avenge Your friend</li>
                Stupid. But,at least you got the snake back. (Believe it or not, people do this quite often)
              </ul>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Mountain/Bear Emergency</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Loud Noise</li>
              Making loud noises and trying to scare off the bear is the best idea when it is violent. The idea is to make yourself seem as threatening as possible to make the bear go away. 
              <li>Run</li>
              Running away from the bear is not a good idea. Bears can run twice as fast as humans. By running from the bear, it sees you as less threatening and will chase you.
              <li>Climb</li>
              Climbing a tree would not be a good idea when trying to escape from a black bear. They are also able to climb trees, probably better than you.
              <li>Throw things at it</li>
              Throwing rocks at a bear to trying to scare it off is the a good idea when the bear is violent. The idea is to make yourself seem as threatening as possible to make the bear go away.
            </ul>
            </li>
