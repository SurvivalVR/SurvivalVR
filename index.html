         <h5>Learning Objective</h5>
         <p>The learning objective of our VR experience is to address the topic of common survival/medical misconceptions and their consequences when people are ill-informed. 
         With so much technology and so many resources at our fingertips, it's easy to forget how much we don't understand about surviving real,
         life-threatening situations. Our VR experience puts the user through a nature hike in which their partner is put in immediate danger
         and/or is severly injured. We then give the user options to pick what they would do to help their partner, making sure to include options 
         about many common misconceptions typical users have on the subject. Although in a way this can be comical, its also a very real fact that people are 
         losing their "innate" survival skills that early humans once had. With this basic knowledge slowly fading, more and more people
         are put in medical danger from other people mis-handling situations. This VR experience, in a way, is trying to demonstrate to the
         user how ready they are for these situations in a less stressful environment and demonstrating the future consequences of their choices. </p>

         <h5>Environment Design</h5>
         <p>The aspects of the environmental design used from the textbook include:
         <ul>
            <li><em>Color and Lighting:</em> We used color extensively to emphasize the green, rolling hills surrounding most of the wall, and the to emphasize the Yellow River and the desert-like terrain that surrounds it. We used natural outdoor sunlight one would experience when walking along the Great Wall.</li>
            <li><em>Audio:</em> We used the spatialized audio of footsteps, to let the user experience the feeling of walking, as well as playing soft Chinese Traditional music in the background, giving the user an experience of the regional culture.</li>
            <li><em>Wayfinding aids:</em> We used traditional floating Chinese lanterns to let the user know in which direction to travel or where to select. The natural guidance of the Wall also helped in giving the user a general sense of direction.</li>
          </ul></p>
